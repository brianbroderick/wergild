Vast is the universe. Trillions of galaxies dot the sky, each with millions of stars and billions of planets. 
We look from the inside out, but what does it look like from the outside in?

Small is the atom. Smaller yet is the electron, neutron, and proton. Yet, this follows the same pattern as the solar system. 
If an electron could be seen, what would it look like? Would its surface be covered by mountains and valleys? 
Could even one electron in a trillion sustain life? What would it look like sitting on an electron looking 
to the sky and seeing a universe of atoms? 

Similar is the macro vs. the micro. The pattern repeats itself, thus does size matter? Is there an array of even smaller
somethings that make up an electron? If so, do they also follow the pattern?

By combining a universe of atoms, an object is formed. Would another object be formed by combining a universe of stars?
What would that be? 

What is life? A complex organism such as a plant or animal is considered alive. These are made up of trillions 
of individual cells, which are also alive. When enough cells die, so does the host, but this doesn't mean the atoms
making up these cells are removed from existence. The nutrients of a fallen leaf are absorbed into the ground and help sustain next year's growth. 

What is consciousness? This is one thing that seems to exist outside the realm of physical matter. Yet, for all of our science, it's difficult to measure. Even more mysteriously, the only consciousness we can guarantee exists is our own.

The entire universe exists from our point of view, and our consciousness exists apart from physcial matter.
