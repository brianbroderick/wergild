## Vast is the universe. 

Trillions of galaxies dot the sky, each with millions of stars and billions of planets. We look from the inside out, but what does it look like from the outside in?

Small is the atom. Smaller yet is the electron, neutron, and proton. Yet, this follows the same pattern as the solar system. If an electron could be seen, what would it look like? Would its surface be covered by mountains and valleys? Could even one electron in a trillion sustain life? What would it look like sitting on an electron looking to the sky and seeing a universe of atoms? 

Similar is the macro vs. the micro. The pattern repeats itself, thus does size matter? Is there an array of even smaller somethings that make up an electron? If so, do they also follow the pattern?

By combining a universe of atoms, an object is formed. Would another object be formed by combining a universe of stars? What would that be? 

## What is life? 

While a plant or animal is alive, so too are each of its trillions of individual cells. When enough cells die, so does the host, but this doesn't mean the atoms making up these cells are removed from existence. The nutrients of a fallen leaf are absorbed into the ground and help sustain next year's growth. 

## What is consciousness? 

This is one thing that seems to exist outside the realm of physical matter. Yet, for all of our science, it's difficult to measure. Even more mysteriously, the only consciousness we can guarantee exists is our own.

If the entire universe exists from our point of view, and our consciousness is largely disconnected from physcial matter, why do we not have all the answers? What are we hiding from ourselves?

Does each living entity exist on its own? Or, does it form part of a much larger consciousness? We've seen how natural ecosystems balance itself. The cheetah preys upon the weakest gazelle, which in turn keeps the herd strong. Seen in this light, an ecosystem is greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps, we are mearly facets of a greater understanding. We feel an inherient connection with other living creatures. Maybe this is why.

If consciousness is attached to physical matter, what would this combined consiousness look like? If we could see from the outside of the universe in, perhaps we would know. 

We are small and insignificant; yet, the sum of our thoughts and experiences is unique. How will we ensure that our existence benefits the collective understanding and that we are not forgotten?
