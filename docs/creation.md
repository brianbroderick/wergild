Vast is the universe. Trillions of galaxies dot the sky, each with millions of stars and billions of planets. 
We look from the inside out, but what does it look like from the outside in?

Small is the atom. Smaller yet is the electron, neutron, and proton. Yet, this follows the same pattern as the solar system. 
If an electron could be seen, what would it look like? Would its surface be covered by mountains and valleys? 
Could even one electron in a trillion sustain life? What would it look like sitting on an electron looking 
to the sky and seeing a universe of atoms? 

What is the electron made of? Are there trillions of somethings vastly smaller that make up one electron? 
If so, do they follow the same pattern?

Similar is the macro vs. the micro. If the pattern repeats itself so, does size matter? 

By combining a universe of atoms, an object is formed. Would another object be formed by combining a universe of stars?
